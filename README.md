Ignition Sensors, a component of [Ignition
Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org), provides numerous sensor models
designed to generate realistic data from simulation environments. Ignition Sensors is used in conjunction with [Ignition Libraries](https://ignitionrobotics/libs), and especially relies on the rendering capabilities from [Ignition Rendering](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/rendering) and physics simulation from [Ignition Physics](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/physics).

# Features

Ignition Sensors provides a set of sensors models that can be
configured at run time to mimic specific real-world sensors. A noise model
is also provided that can be used to introduce Gaussian or custom noise
models into sensor streams.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/sensors/4.0/installation.html).

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-sensors/raw/master/examples/).
