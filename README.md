Ignition Sensors, a component of [Ignition
Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org), provides numerous sensor models
designed to generate realistic data from simulation environments. Ignition Sensors is used in conjunction with [Ignition Libraries](https://ignitionrobotics/libs), and especially relies on the rendering capabilities from [Ignition Rendering](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/rendering) and physics simulation from [Ignition Physics](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/physics).

# Features

Ignition Sensors provides a set of sensors models that can be
configured at run time to mimic specific real-world sensors. A noise model
is also provided that can be used to introduce Gaussian or custom noise
models into sensor streams.

# Install

We recommend following the [Binary Install](#binary-install) instructions to get up and running as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The [Source Install](#source-install) instructions should be used if you need the very latest software improvements, you need to modify the code, or you plan to make a contribution.

## Binary Install

On Ubuntu systems, `apt-get` can be used to install `ignition-sensors`:

**Ubuntu Bionic**

1. Configure package repositories.

    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
    ```
    
    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-prerelease `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-prerelease.list'
    ```
    
    ```
    wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
 
```
sudo apt install libignition-sensors-dev
```

At the time of this writing, there is only one released version of
ignition-sensors. It's possible that additional versions have been released,
  in which case you can use add a numeral (2, 3, etc) to install a different
  version. For example, to install version 2:

```
sudo apt-get install libignition-sensors2-dev
```

## Source Install

Source installation can be performed in UNIX systems by first installing the
necessary prerequisites followed by building from source. 

### Prerequisites

Ignition Sensors requires:

  * [Ubuntu Bionic](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)
  * [Ignition CMake](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/cmake)
  * [Ignition Math](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/math)
  * [Ignition Common](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/common)
  * [Ignition Transport](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/transport)
  * [Ignition Rendering](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/rendering)
  * [Ignition Msgs](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/msgs)
  * [SDFormat](https://github.com/osrf/sdformat)
  * [Protobuf3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

### Building from source

1. Make sure you are running [Ubuntu Bionic](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/).

2. Install the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

3. Configure gcc8

    ```
    sudo apt-get install g++-8
    ```

    ```
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 --slave /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-8
    ```

4. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-sensors
    ```

5. Configure and build

    ```
    cd ign-sensors; mkdir build;cd build; cmake ..;  make
    ```

6. Optionally, install Ignition Common

    ```
    sudo make install
    ```

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-sensors/raw/master/examples/).

# Documentation

API and tutorials can be found at [https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/sensors](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/sensors).

You can also generate the documentation from a clone of this repository by following these steps.

1. You will need Doxygen. On Ubuntu Doxygen can be installed using

    ```
    sudo apt-get install doxygen
    ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-sensors
    ```

3. Configure and build the documentation.

    ```
    cd ign-sensors; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../; make doc
    ```

4. View the documentation by running the following command from the build directory.

    ```
    firefox doxygen/html/index.html
    ```

# Testing

Follow these steps to run tests and static code analysis in your clone of this repository.

1. Follow the [source install instruction](#source-install).

2. Run tests.

    ```
    make test
    ```

3. Static code checker.

    ```
    make codecheck
    ```
