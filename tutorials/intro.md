## What is Gazebo Sensors?

Gazebo Sensors is an open source library that provides a set of sensor and
noise models accessible through a C++ interface. The goal of Gazebo
Sensors is to generate realistic sensor data suitable for use in robotic
applications and simulation. The code behind Gazebo Sensors was originally
developed as a suite of sensor models internal to
[Gazebo Classic](http://classic.gazebosim.org). With the addition of some
refactoring, the high-quality sensor models are now available for use in
your next project without encumbering you with a complete simulation system.
