## What is Ignition Sensors?

Ignition Senors is an open source library that provides a set of sensor and
noise models accessible through a C++ interface. The goal of Ignition
Sensors is to generate realistic sensor data suitable for use in robotic
applications and simulation. The code behind Ignition Sensors was originally
developed as a suite of sensor models internal to
[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org). With the addition of some refactoring, the
high-quality sensor models previously contained within Gazebo are now
available for use in your next project without encumbering you with
a complete simulation system.
